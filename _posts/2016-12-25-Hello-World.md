title: How this Blog was created
---

This Blog was created using [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on Github as starting point. It is a very good point to get started with one's personal blog with static pages only and without Databases such as used in WordPress and other micro blogging sites.
The best way to get started is forking the above repository or one of the custom themes as mentioned [Here](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now#other-forkable-themes). Next one can update their site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of the repository (shown below).

The easiest way to make your first post is to go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
