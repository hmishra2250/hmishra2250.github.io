<p>
Hi there! I'm Himadri, currently in Fourth Year of Integrated Dual Degree (B.Tech and M.Tech), Computer Science and Engineering at IIT(BHU), Varanasi. I am a Competitive Programmer (Machine Learning and Algorithmic) and currently a researcher in Machine Learning, mainly in Deep Learning. 
</p>
<p>
I started working in Machine Learning from my Sophomore year where i had a glimpse of actual Machine Learning Projects through the Exploratory Project of 4th semester, through which i learned some basic analyis techniquues in R and thus helped me get into ML. <br>
I took some basic courses in ML to get started, started coding in python and did my B.Tech minor project in <a href="https://github.com/hmishra2250/SixthSemProject">Movie Retrieval</a> which involved retrieving relevant Movies based on user queries. <br>
This project paved way for me to get hands dirty with Deep Learning.
</p>
<p>
I completed my <a href="https://github.com/hmishra2250/BTP">Bachleor's Major project</a> aka BTP on Botnet Detection in Networks using Machine Learning wherein the focus was mainly on advanced ML techniques such as Gradient Boosting Regression and Deep Learning
</p>
<p>
My Current work involves working on One Shot Learning using Neural Networks (Neural Turing Machine Architecture) on small datasets. <br>
I am also consistently involved in Competitive Programming. Some of my major achievements are Getting top 8% in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity/">Kaggle AllState Claims contest</a>, Getting into ACM ICPC regionals twice. <br>
I have built some cool stuffs such as ChatBots using Microsoft Bot Framework during the course of my Internshit @ Microsoft. <br>
I have also delivered a small talk in the seminar course on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/automatic-machine-learning-himadri-mishra?trk=prof-post">Automatic Machine Learning</a> in the 7th Semester.
</p>
<p>
My Master Theses is going to be related to some application of Deep Learning on Images (Abstract Idea), is going to commence in 8th semester and will be completed by 10th semester. I am currently following <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mitchell/ftp/mlbook.html">Machine Learning by Tom Mitchelle</a> and <a href=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/machine-learning-0">Machine Learning, A Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin P. Murphy</a> to get strong background knowledge in Machine Learning. I am also looking forward to begin studying <a href="http://www.deeplearningbook.org/">Deep Learning  by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville</a> to gain some solid foundations in Deep Learning.
